  title: Simplify interface for GeoIpDatabase
  area: Java API
  details: |
    External implementations of the `ingest-geoip` `GeoIpDatabase` interface, which
    adapts a maxmind `DatabaseReader` to various lookups, will no longer be required
    to provide a separate mapping for each type supported by the GeoIP processor.
    Instead they must provide a _generic_ mapping that can be used when looking up
    results for _any_ of the supported GeoIP processor database types.
  impact: |
    Previously-valid implementations `org.elasticsearch.ingest.geoip.GeoIpDatabase`
    are no longer valid; implementations must be adjusted to meet the new interface,
    similar to each previous change to the interface when a new supported type was added.

    The only known external implementation is in Logstash's "Elastic Integration" filter
    plugin.
